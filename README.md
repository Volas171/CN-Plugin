To use this plugin, you must fork this repo and add your own code. Should the foundation have an issue, it will be fixed for you too!


### Building a Jar

5) type `gradlew jar` and execute (`./gradlew jar` on linux)

### Installing

Simply place the output jar from the step above in your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.
List your currently installed plugins/mods by running the `mods` command.

### Coniguring

Then edit setings.cn like a JSON file, make sure to only edit the <data> and not other JSON objects.
